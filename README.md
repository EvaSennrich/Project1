### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Yes, the topics and lab assignments from this week were really helpful for making this project. In my opinion, all of them covered the topics needed in order to build 
this app. Likewise, the review code provided the day before of the deadline helped understood better how API's work and terms such as "async", "await" and "fetch" were 
well explained. However, I still feel I need more practice on how fecth data from API's.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
I would have added more content to the app such as adding different types of movies genres and movie trailers. I would have also made it look more as netflix WebApp where 
user would have been prompt to sign up and create an account for more accessibility to the page. I also would have added more UI/UX design to it.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

I did not see any of my peer's demos since we all were starting the project, but I feel like I could have done more features for the app. On the other hand, something in particular that did 
not go as planned was accesing the API data. At the beginning, while I was creating my getdata() function I did not know which URL to use but then by searching up in google and going
through the API documentation I realized that the API URL has 3 pieces of data and I was able to figure that out before the instructor mentioned it and be able to access the movies data.
